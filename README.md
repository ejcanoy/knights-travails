# Knight Travails

The Chess Knight Shortest Path Calculator is a JavaScript program designed to determine the shortest path a chess knight can take between two given locations on a standard 8x8 chessboard.

The program utilizes the movement pattern of a knight, which moves in an L-shaped pattern, two squares in one direction (horizontally or vertically) and one square in the perpendicular direction. It takes two input locations: the starting position and the ending position, and then calculates the shortest path the knight can follow to reach the destination.

The output of the program will be the sequence of knight moves that the player needs to make to reach the destination in the fewest number of steps.
With this calculator, chess enthusiasts can quickly determine the optimal path for their knight to navigate the chessboard and plan their moves accordingly.
